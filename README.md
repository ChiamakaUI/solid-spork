# Slipstream

**Ride the leader, land low-latency.**

A smart Solana transaction stack built for the Superteam Nigeria Advanced Infrastructure Challenge:
**Jito bundle submission** with a **dynamic tip engine** priced from live tip-floor data, full
**lifecycle tracking** (submitted → processed → confirmed → finalized) over **Yellowstone gRPC**,
deterministic **failure classification**, and a **Claude-powered autonomous retry agent** that owns
every retry/abort decision — with its reasoning logged as structured JSON.

Everything below comes from running this stack against **mainnet-beta**. Slot numbers in the
lifecycle log are explorer-verifiable.

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env        # fill in the values below
npm run smoke               # verify all 3 integrations with ZERO SOL
npm run dev -- --bundles 2 --inject-faults 0    # dress rehearsal
npm run run:campaign        # 12 bundles, 2 fault injections
npm run report              # turn logs/ into report.md (numbers + explorer links)
```

`npm run report` reads `logs/lifecycle.jsonl` + `logs/agent-decisions.jsonl` and writes
`logs/report.md` — landing rate, measured processed→confirmed deltas, explorer-verifiable
signatures, and the fault→recovery narrative. It refuses to certify a run that used the MOCK
agent, so every `TODO(campaign)` below is filled from a real, live-agent campaign.

`.env`:

| var | what |
|---|---|
| `GRPC_ENDPOINT` / `GRPC_X_TOKEN` | Yellowstone gRPC (PublicNode personal token works; a dedicated provider is better) |
| `RPC_URL` | standard JSON-RPC endpoint — a dedicated provider (Helius/QuickNode/Solinfra) is strongly preferred over the public `api.mainnet-beta` endpoint, which is rate-limited and lags |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | powers the retry agent (`AGENT_MODEL`, default claude-haiku-4-5) |
| `KEYPAIR_PATH` | payer keypair JSON (fund with ≥0.01 SOL) |
| `BLOCK_ENGINE_URL` / `BLOCK_ENGINE_HTTP` | Jito block engine — **pin one region** (default `amsterdam.mainnet.block-engine.jito.wtf`), not the global anycast endpoint (see Operational lessons) |
| `JITO_AUTH_KEY` _(optional)_ | x-jito-auth API key for higher rate limits; unset = unauthenticated default sends, which Jito supports |
| `JITO_AUTH_KEYPAIR_PATH` _(optional)_ | searcher keypair for gRPC challenge-response auth; unset = default sends |

**Architecture document:** the hosted dashboard's **Architecture** tab is the full architecture
document — data-flow diagram, component map, infrastructure decisions, failure-handling strategy,
and the AI agent's responsibilities. It ships in the same deploy as the live ops console
(`dashboard/`, `npm run dev` → the *Architecture* nav tab; public URL: **TODO — Vercel link**).

## Layout

```
src/
  stream/     Yellowstone gRPC slot + transaction streaming, reconnect & backpressure
  lifecycle/  commitment-stage tracker + deterministic failure classifier
  tip/        dynamic tip engine: ema50 × congestion × urgency, clamped to [1000, maxTipLamports]
  jito/       bundle construction, leader-window targeting, submission, status
  agent/      Claude retry agent: failure context in, decision JSON out
  fault/      fault injector (holds a signed tx until its blockhash expires on-chain)
  log/        lifecycle.jsonl + agent-decisions.jsonl writers
  main.ts     campaign orchestrator — contains NO retry policy; the agent owns it
```

## The three required questions

### Q1 — What does the delta between `processed_at` and `confirmed_at` tell you about network health?

`processed` means one validator executed the transaction in a block; `confirmed` means a
supermajority (>2/3 of stake) has voted on that block. The delta is therefore a direct
measurement of **how fast stake-weighted consensus is forming**:

- **Healthy:** votes land within 1–2 slots, so the delta sits around **400–800 ms**.
- **Degraded:** a growing delta means vote transactions are competing for blockspace
  (congestion), the cluster is processing forks, or the block's slot is at risk of being
  skipped — the block exists but the network is slow to commit to it.

<!-- /AUTO:q1-deltas -->

Our tracker timestamps each stage from the Yellowstone stream the moment the slot containing
the transaction is promoted, so the deltas in `logs/lifecycle.jsonl` are wall-clock honest.

### Q2 — Why never fetch a blockhash at `finalized` commitment for a time-sensitive transaction?

A blockhash is valid for **150 blocks (~60 s)**, counted from the slot where it was produced —
not from when you fetched it. `finalized` lags the tip by **~32 slots (~13 s)**, so a
finalized blockhash hands you a transaction that has already burned **>20% of its validity
window before you've signed anything**. Under time pressure (leader-window targeting, retries,
auction queues) that lost window is the difference between landing and `expired_blockhash`.

We fetch at `confirmed`: old enough that every fork and every simulator knows it, fresh enough
to keep nearly the whole window. (Fetching at `processed` is the opposite failure: a blockhash
from a minority fork can be rolled back, producing instant `BlockhashNotFound` rejections.)

This is not theoretical for us — our failure evidence collector records
`slotsSinceBlockhashFetch` at detection time, and the agent's decision JSON reasons about the
150-slot window explicitly when it chooses whether a resubmission needs a refresh.

### Q3 — What happens to your bundle if the Jito leader skips their slot?

The bundle **does not execute and does not carry over**. Bundles only execute inside
Jito-Solana leaders' blocks via the block-engine auction; if the targeted leader skips their
slot, the auction result for that slot dies with it. Three consequences we engineered around:

1. **No automatic re-targeting** — the block engine does not queue your bundle for the next
   Jito leader. You must resubmit, and the next Jito leader window may be many slots away
   (we observed gaps of 0–60+ slots via `getNextScheduledLeader`).
2. **Atomicity can leak.** Per Jito's own docs, in uncle/skipped-slot scenarios bundle
   transactions can be **rebroadcast individually**, hitting the normal banking stage where
   bundle atomicity and revert protection do not apply. Our bundles keep the tip transfer in
   the *same transaction* as the payload, so a partially-landed bundle can never pay a tip
   for work that didn't execute.
3. **Status fades to `Invalid`.** The skipped bundle drops out of the engine's 5-minute
   lookback, indistinguishable from never-ingested — so our classifier treats block-engine
   status as primary evidence and on-chain absence as confirmation, then hands the agent the
   leader-schedule context to decide between immediate resubmission and waiting for the next
   window.

## Failure handling (not happy-path)

Failures are first-class: a deterministic classifier maps raw evidence (stream tx errors,
block-engine inflight status, `isBlockhashValid` at detection) onto failure classes
(`expired_blockhash`, `fee_too_low`, `compute_exceeded`, `bundle_failure`, `unknown`), and the
**agent** — not the orchestrator — decides what changes: refresh blockhash, re-price the tip
(it sees live percentiles), delay N slots, or abort. Every decision is logged with reasoning,
confidence, and rejected alternatives in `logs/agent-decisions.jsonl`.

The campaign also **injects real faults**: the injector holds a fully-signed transaction until
its blockhash genuinely expires on-chain (polling `isBlockhashValid`), then submits it anyway.
The failure, detection, classification, and recovery that follow are all real.

## Operational lessons (learned the hard way)

The most valuable thing we learned: **Jito's unauthenticated rate limit is one request per
second per IP, shared across every method — and the penalty for exceeding it is _silent_.**
Once an IP is penalized, `sendBundle` keeps returning a valid bundle_id, but the bundle never
enters the auction and never lands. This is a *shadow-drop*, and it is easy to misdiagnose as
"tip too low."

We chased exactly that wrong diagnosis, then ruled it out with evidence rather than guesses:

- **Tip is not the variable.** A clean tip ladder climbing 150k → 2.5M lamports landed nothing.
  A 2M-lamport bundle, watched on Jito's gRPC `bundleResults` stream, never returned
  `stateAuctionBidRejected` — it was not priced out of the auction, it never reached it.
  (For reference, on a healthy IP our inclusion floor was ~3.0M lamports — see below.)
- **Region is not the variable.** Re-running the ladder pinned to the lowest-latency regional
  endpoint (Amsterdam, 337 ms TLS RTT vs the global anycast endpoint's 343 ms) changed nothing.
- **Auth is not the variable.** Bundles had landed fully unauthenticated; an API key raises
  rate limits, it does not grant the ability to land.

The proof came from the chain itself. `getSignaturesForAddress` on the payer showed that **0 of
9 bundles** fired during the penalized window ever executed on-chain — while **4 bundles had
landed ~24 h earlier from the same wallet and the same code**, at 3.0–3.4M-lamport tips,
including one finalized **top-of-block** (`5bQBJ7oj…`, slot 426110964, tx index 16). Same payer,
same builder, ~24 h apart: the only thing that changed was the IP's standing with the block
engine. An explicit `Rate limit exceeded: 1 per second for txn requests` confirmed the cause.

The fixes are architectural, not parametric, and all three ship in the stack:

1. **A global client-side token gate** (1 request / 1.5 s, the first call charged) in front of
   *every* block-engine call — leader lookups, tip-account fetches, sends, status polls — so a
   campaign can never out-run the limit and penalize its own IP.
2. **Rate-limit back-off** around each gRPC call: a transient `Resource exhausted` is absorbed
   with growing back-off and retried, instead of crashing a 12-bundle run mid-flight.
3. **Chain-based landing detection is the source of truth.** On the unauthenticated endpoint the
   block-engine's own status lies — `getInflightBundleStatuses` reported `Invalid` for the
   entire life of a bundle that finalized on-chain, and the `bundleResults` stream yields no
   reasons at all. So landing is confirmed on-chain: we poll `getSignatureStatuses` from submit
   until the signature reaches each commitment level, never by trusting `sendBundle`'s acceptance.

   > Yellowstone `transactionStatus` subscription first — and it *missed 2 of 2 real landings*,

## Verifying the lifecycle log

`logs/lifecycle.jsonl` — one JSON entry per logical transaction: every attempt with its
signature, blockhash fetch slot, tip basis (formula inputs included), target leader slot,
stage timestamps, failure classification, and the IDs of the agent decisions that drove each
retry. Landed entries' slots and signatures can be checked on any explorer.
